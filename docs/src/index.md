# PlutoTool.jl

PlutoTool is intended as a command line tool for manipulating Pluto
Notebooks.

This documentation is "internal", but one might use these functions as
a thin vaneer over what Pluto already provides.

Though it was not hard to figure out what Pluto functions to call to
implement PlutoTool, I wich Pluto had a formal API.

```@autodocs
Modules = [ PlutoTool ]
